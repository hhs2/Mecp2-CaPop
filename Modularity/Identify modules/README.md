# Identify modules

consensus_cluster: consensus clustering method for nondeterministic community detection algorithms. Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00336

consensus_coclassify: produce consensus matrix to determine proportion of repeated community partitions in which two nodes are placed into the same module

consensuscheck: check if consensus matrix is block diagonal. If yes, consensus clustering is finished 

consensus_cluster_adapted: consensus clustering method accounting for variability in probabilistic thresholding 

consensus_cluster_variable_check: runs a number of different variables to show how they affect module partitions over time
