consensus_cluster: consensus clustering method for nondeterministic community detection algorithms. Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00336

consensus_coclassify: produce consensus matrix to determine proportion of repeated community partitions in which two nodes are placed into the same module

consensuscheck: check if consensus matrix is block diagonal. If yes, consensus clustering is finished
